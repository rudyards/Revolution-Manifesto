  %em MTGO Commander
  is a variant of Commander format meant for two-player games.

%p
  Unlike other Commander banlists, this one is maintained by Wizards of the Coast, and is primarily meant for MTGO, and for 1 vs 1 games rather than multiplayer.

%p
  Decks consist of 100 cards and no sideboard, one of which is a legendary creature chosen as a commander.

%p
  Except for basic lands, all cards are allowed in only 1 copy. No card is allowed if its color identity contains colors outside color identity of the chosen commander.
